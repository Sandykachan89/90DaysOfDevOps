You will create a 90-day personal DevOps learning plan that clearly defines:

1) What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?

DevOps is about the Process. 
It is a set of practices and tools used to automate the software development lifecycle, 
ensuring that code moves from a developer's laptop to production quickly and reliably.

Primary Goal: To accelerate software delivery while maintaining high quality and reliability.

Core Practices:
CI/CD: Automating the building, testing, and deployment of code.
Automation: Removing manual, error-prone steps from the release process.
Monitoring & Observability: Real-time tracking of application performance to identify bugs before they impact users.
Key Tools: Jenkins, GitLab CI, Docker, Kubernetes, and Prometheus

Cloud Engineering is about the Platform. 
It focuses on designing, building, 
and managing the virtual infrastructure (servers, storage, networks) on providers like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

Primary Goal: To build a secure, scalable, and cost-effective environment where applications can run.

Key Responsibilities:
Architecture Design: Designing virtual networks (VPCs), subnets, and load balancers.
Resource Management: Provisioning virtual machines, databases, and storage (e.g., EC2, RDS, S3).
Cost Optimization: Monitoring and adjusting cloud usage to prevent budget overruns.
Security: Implementing identity management (IAM), encryption, and compliance guardrails. 

2) Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?

To get Job and flexibility to work independently while maintaining worklife balance.

3) Where do you want to reach?

Expert in DevOps Concept with lots of freelancing/remote opportunities.

4) How you will stay consistent every single day?

Devoting min 2 hrs study daily for next 3 months
